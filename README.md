# SyncRoom

**Crystal-clear video calls with perfectly synchronized watch parties.**
Google Meet + Teleparty in one stateless, self-hostable web app.

Create a room, share the code, talk face-to-face in up to 4K60 — then paste a YouTube / Google Drive / MP4 / HLS / DASH link and everyone watches in lock-step: play, pause, seek, speed, late-join catch-up and automatic drift correction.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install       # installs all workspaces (shared, server, client)
npm run dev       # server on :3001 + client on :5173 (proxied)
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>, create a room, open a second browser/incognito window and join with the code.

**Production:**

```bash
npm run build     # builds server (tsup) + client (vite)
npm start         # one Node process serves the SPA + signaling on :3001
```

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20
- A modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended; Firefox and Safari supported)

## Scripts

| Command                   | What it does                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`             | Server (tsx watch) + client (Vite HMR) concurrently |
| `npm run build`           | Production build of all workspaces                  |
| `npm start`               | Run the production server (serves built SPA too)    |
| `npm run typecheck`       | Strict TypeScript across all workspaces             |
| `npm run lint` / `format` | ESLint / Prettier                                   |
| `npm test`                | Unit + integration tests (Vitest)                   |
| `npm run test:e2e`        | Playwright end-to-end tests (build first)           |

## Feature highlights

- **Rooms** — random Meet-style or custom codes, host badge, lock/unlock, kick, force-mute, host transfer, end-for-all, refresh recovery, duplicate-join protection, rate limiting.
- **Calls** — P2P WebRTC mesh (up to 8), camera/mic/screen share, device switching, quality presets up to **4K @ 60fps**, noise suppression, echo cancellation, per-peer RTT / packet-loss / bitrate indicators, picture-in-picture, fullscreen, auto-reconnect.
- **Watch together** — YouTube, Google Drive (with documented limitations), MP4/WebM, HLS, MPEG-DASH. Host-authoritative sync with clock-offset estimation and invisible playback-rate drift correction. Queue + shared-controls mode.
- **Chat** — realtime messages, emoji, typing indicator, read receipts, image/file sharing (drag & drop), copy, delete-own, timestamps, unread badge, desktop notifications.
- **UI** — dark/light themes, glassmorphism, keyboard shortcuts, reduced-motion support, responsive from phone to ultrawide.

## Deploy for free (Vercel + Render)

The recommended zero-cost setup: static SPA on **Vercel**, Socket.IO signaling server on **Render's free plan**. Media never touches either host (calls are peer-to-peer), so free tiers are genuinely enough. Both provide HTTPS automatically — which WebRTC and `wss://` require.

**1. Push the repo to GitHub** (both platforms deploy from it).

**2. Deploy the server on Render**

1. [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com) → **New → Blueprint** → select your repo. Render reads [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) and creates the `syncroom-server` web service (free plan, health-checked at `/healthz`).
2. In the service's **Environment** tab set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to your future Vercel URLs, e.g. `https://syncroom.vercel.app,https://*.vercel.app` (the wildcard lets preview deployments connect).
3. Note the server URL, e.g. `https://syncroom-server.onrender.com`.

**3. Deploy the client on Vercel**

1. [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → import the repo. [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) already sets the build (`npm run build -w client`), output (`client/dist`) and the SPA rewrite so `/room/<code>` deep links work.
2. Add the environment variable `VITE_SERVER_URL = https://syncroom-server.onrender.com` (build-time — set it **before** the first build, redeploy if you change it).
3. Deploy. If your final Vercel domain differs from what you set in step 2.2, update `CLIENT_ORIGIN` on Render.

**4. (Recommended) TURN for strict NATs** — create a free [Open Relay](https://www.metered.ca/tools/openrelay/) account and add `VITE_TURN_URL`, `VITE_TURN_USERNAME`, `VITE_TURN_CREDENTIAL` on Vercel, then redeploy. Without TURN, ~10–15% of peer pairs can't connect.

**5. (Optional) Kill the cold start** — Render free sleeps after 15 min idle (first join then waits ~50 s). Point a free [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) monitor at `https://<your-server>/healthz` every 5 minutes; one always-on service fits within Render's 750 free hours/month.

Alternative single-host deploys (Fly.io/VPS via the included [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile), or any Node host) are covered in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
